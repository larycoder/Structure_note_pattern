# Data Storing Guideline

This repository used to discuss about my personal idea and hypothesis on processing and storing data both in paper and digital devices. (this is personal notes)

## Section 1: The note

Using for noting enough value info of 1 note

1. General ideas of note:

- Try to list out fast info
- Add some personal command about that info
- Add date for note info

2. Structure of note:

- Begin part ---> name: {note content}
- Command part ---> command + {newline} + {+ commend of note} [each line is 1 command]
- Finish part ---> date: {date of note}
- Each note distinct by 1 space

3. hashtag:

- Help easily classify note
- Structure of hashtag:

- On the top of Note.md ---> add hashtag table:

| hashtag name |  hashtag description |
|--------------|----------------------|
| #hashtag     |         demo         |

- Add #{hashtag} in the first line of each note path insteal of name

-- Date of pattern (v1.1): 2019-03-21


## Section 2: Permanent Data

Normally, I prefer to use paper for quick noting while digital device like computer for holding image and lecture slides. However, there are some problems on concentrating data and looking back data. Since the digital computer noting is convenient for searching back with well design and representation, it is difficult for quick noting during class time, the notebook is better choice for real-time writing because of its flexible both in drawing, noting and free-style representation. The pros and cons of both 2 types leading me to use both during my daily life in messy way. For example, a same information about a lecture, sometimes, was noted in notebook and also could be contained some draw saving in computer. Because of this, my own data is scattered too much and hard to managed.

For solving these messy and gaining back the controller, I analyzed and provides some strictly rules for better storing:

1. Notebook is used for real-time note and same with digital note program. But served only for temporary data.
2. Digital system will be used for permanent data which will be absorbed from temporary data.
3. Data process will be in 3 steps: Collecting data into temporary space (notebook), cleaning and structuring temp data, digitalize data to permanent storage (file system).
